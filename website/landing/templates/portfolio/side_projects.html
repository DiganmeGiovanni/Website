      <p>
        During my career I had the opportunity to work with multiple technology
        stacks, Iâ€™ve been creating enterprise systems, apps and internal tools mainly with
        Javascript, Java, Laravel, Docker, Python, Swift and another langs/technologies.

        check my public side projects on my
        <a href="https://github.com/DiganmeGiovanni">Github account</a>.

        i created for a few of the technologies when
